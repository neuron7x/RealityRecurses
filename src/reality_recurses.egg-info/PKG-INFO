# RealityRecurses

RealityRecurses is a **physically bounded, causal agent architecture** for building **reproducible and verifiable** intelligent behavior under explicit constraints: energy/entropy accounting, bounded memory, causal interventions, and self-audit invariants.

## Quickstart

```bash
python -m pip install -e .
pytest -q
python scripts/audit.py
python scripts/run_simulation.py --steps 5 --json
```

## What this repository provides

- Agent loop with explicit budgets (energy, entropy, information throughput)
- Causal core with intervention (`do`) and counterfactual hooks
- Thermodynamic memory (working/episodic/semantic) with bounded growth and controlled forgetting
- Self-audit that produces a pass/fail report suitable for CI gating
- GitHub Actions CI for pull requests (tests + audit)
